# Automatic Detection and Recognition of Logos for Brand Monitoring in Images
Welcome to the Logo Recognition repository! This project is built to develop a deep learning model for recognizing logos from images using TensorFlow. 

## Dataset

The dataset contains images of various logos, including Apple, Asus, Coca-Cola, and Samsung. The dataset is organized into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring thorough evaluation of the model.

## Getting Started

To get going, simply clone this repository and run the provided Python script. It'll download the dataset, process the images, and train a convolutional neural network model for logo recognition.

## Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict logos from unseen images. Additionally, I've included sample code to visualize the predictions on some images from the dataset, giving you a glimpse into the model's capabilities.
Future Improvements

## Possible to do list:

Fine-tune the model architecture to boost accuracy.
Expand the dataset to cover a wider range of logo variations. (contributions to the dataset are encouraged!)
Explore transfer learning techniques to speed up training.
Integrate the model into real-world applications, like mobile apps or web services. (as part of a bachelor thesis, this project will be integrated into a mobile app developed in Kotlin)
